		I'm Samuel Kajava, a developer situated in Gothenburg, Sweden. I'm a PhD student at
		Chalmers University of Technology.

        Prior to my PhD studies, I have graduated from the software engineering <i>civilingenj√∂r</i> program
        with a bachelor's degree in software engineering and master's degree in computer science. My BSc thesis
        covers a way of introducing performance benchmarking into CI pipelines on GitHub, with scalability in mind.
        
        My master thesis work introduced a fully automatic approach for detecting prototype pollution in client-side

		I basically live in Neovim and would label my interests as language-agnostic, but most of my
		experience lies in files which end with
		<span class="go">.go</span>,
		<span class="rust">.rs</span>,
		<span class="cpp">.cpp</span>,
		<span class="java">.java</span> and
		<span class="node">.ts</span>.
		I host my projects on <a href="https://github.com/xenomorphling">GitHub</a>, and will always be the
		most up to date source of what I am working on.

        I'm looking into writing some blog-esque stuff where I express my thoughts about programming.</i>
